<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!--  [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

TRAW is a typescript reddit API wrapper, a successor to  [Snoowrap by Not An aardvark](https://github.com/not-an-aardvark/snoowrap). The main drive to start the project was to address the lack of maintenance on snoowrap, leading to out-of-date functions, and secondly, to address potential security concerns arrising from the modules upon which it relied. The opportunity was also taken to incorporate type safety by moving from javascript to typescript, leading hopefully to greater reliability presently and in the future, as well as improving the end-developer's experience by making some function calls more intuitive.
